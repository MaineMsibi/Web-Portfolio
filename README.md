### What I learned

Building this web portfolio allowed me to refresh my basic HTML knowledge and discover exciting new CSS possibilities. I've also enjoyed exploring the basics of JavaScript. Reinforcing my understanding of HTML structure and semantics has been valuable, while experimenting with modern CSS techniques has opened up a world of creative design, animation, and layout options. This process has not only expanded my skill set but also significantly boosted my confidence in web development. I now feel more capable of creating visually appealing and responsive websites.

### Continued development

I aim to sharpen my HTML and CSS skills so that I can delve more into JavaScript with a stronger grasp of the fundamentals.
